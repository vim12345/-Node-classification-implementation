# -Node-classification-implementation

# Description:
Node classification is a fundamental task in graph learning where the goal is to predict the label of a node based on its features and graph structure. It's widely used in applications like social network analysis, citation networks, and biological graphs. In this project, we'll use a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to perform node classification on a well-known graph dataset â€” Cora.

# ðŸ§ª Python Implementation (Node Classification with GCN on Cora Dataset)
We'll use PyTorch Geometric (PyG) for this task.

#  Install Required Package:
pip install torch-geometric

# âœ… What It Does:
* Loads the Cora citation graph, where nodes represent papers and edges represent citations.

* Builds a 2-layer Graph Convolutional Network to learn node embeddings.

* Uses those embeddings to predict node labels.

* Evaluates performance on train, validation, and test splits.
